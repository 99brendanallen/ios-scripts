# iOS Scripts

A set of scripts to manage iOS projects.

## Installation

To install the scripts into any iOS project you just need to run the install script (no pound intended :wink:)

```
git clone git@github.com:guidomb/ios-scripts.git
cd ios-scripts
./install PATH_TO_IOS_PROJECT_FOLDER
```

The first time you run this script you would probably want to generate .env file that is needed for the scripts
to work.

## Usage

### script/bootstrap

### script/build

### script/test

### script/coverage

### script/update

### script/cibuild
